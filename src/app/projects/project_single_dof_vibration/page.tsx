                This program was created as the final project for my course at
                the ATARI city campus. It was a group project; however, it was
                done all by myself as a test for my own skills. Project
                assignment subject for our group changed later, and this was
                never presented. I wrote it entirely using Java and my SQL
                knowledge was used because MySQL was used as the database. The
                UI was designed using NetBeans IDEs drag-and-drop UI designer.
                The MySQL workbench was used to manage the database.
