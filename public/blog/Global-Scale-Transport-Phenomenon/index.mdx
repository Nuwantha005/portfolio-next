Earth's atmosphere and oceans can be viewed as a rather scattered bodies of fluid that appears to stay there forever with minor movements such as gusts of winds or small waves of ocean. But that's far from the truth, and it turns out they do move in the planetary scale all the time.

Here are several of my favorite of these movements that i find fascinating. They influence global weather patterns significantly, and are vital for the ecological sustainability of our planet.

# 1. [[The Gulf Stream]]
This is the phenomenon with the warm water from the Mexican Gulf travelling toward the Europe on the ocean surface, crossing the North Atlantic Ocean. This "hot" water then warms the entirety of Western Europe and this is the reason why the Canada, at the same latitude as the Europe is much colder compared to Europe. This is also the reason why it rains so much in UK.

After the heat in this water gets absorbed into the atmosphere of the Western Europe, the water temperature drops. This, combined with the evaporation increases the density and the salinity of the water, and they sink down to the ocean floor. 

This leads to the fascinating phenomenon known as **[[North Atlantic Deep Water]]**. This high density water shrinks several kilometers down in massive columns hundreds of meters wide. This water then gets circulated around the world and this takes more than thousand years. There are several of these circulations as shown in the following figure.

# 3. Modelling Atmosphere and the Ocean
- These occur naturally in the numerical models when right boundary conditions and physics are applied

# 4. Trivia
- It turns out when the connection between 2 American continents were made near the modern day Panama due to Tectonic plate movement, a ocean circulation similar to this has stopped. This circulation is the one that bought rain to Africa, and its absence led to food from trees becoming scarce for out ancestors. Its believed that this led to them finally walking in the ground and using [[Persistence Hunting]] to find more food, which eventually led to us. Isn't that just insane ???
