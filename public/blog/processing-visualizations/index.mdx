## Why Processing?

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It's perfect for:

- Quick prototyping of visual ideas
- Mathematical visualizations
- Interactive art installations
- Educational demonstrations

## Getting Started

Here's a simple Processing sketch that draws a rotating circle:

```java
float angle = 0;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  background(20);
  translate(width/2, height/2);
  
  float x = cos(angle) * 100;
  float y = sin(angle) * 100;
  
  stroke(255);
  line(0, 0, x, y);
  
  fill(100, 150, 255);
  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);
  
  angle += 0.02;
}
```

## Fourier Series Visualization

One of my favorite projects was visualizing Fourier series - showing how complex shapes can be broken down into simple circular motions.

### The Concept

Any periodic function can be represented as a sum of sines and cosines:

$$f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)]$$

### The Visual Result

By drawing circles whose radii and frequencies are determined by Fourier coefficients, we can recreate any shape!

## Complex Function Mapping

Another fascinating visualization is mapping complex functions. When we apply a function like $f(z) = z^2$ to points in the complex plane, we get beautiful transformations.

| Function | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| $z^2$ | Doubles angles, squares distances |
| $e^z$ | Maps strips to sectors |
| $\sin(z)$ | Creates wave-like distortions |

## Tips for Better Visualizations

1. **Start simple** - Build complexity gradually
2. **Use color meaningfully** - Map values to hues
3. **Add interactivity** - Let users explore
4. **Optimize performance** - Use appropriate data structures
