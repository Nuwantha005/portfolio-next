## Introduction

Single degree of freedom (SDOF) vibration systems are fundamental to understanding mechanical vibrations. In this article, we'll explore the theory behind SDOF systems and how to simulate them using MATLAB.

## The Mathematical Model

A single DOF system can be represented by a mass-spring-damper system. The equation of motion is:

$$m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F(t)$$

Where:
- $m$ is the mass
- $c$ is the damping coefficient
- $k$ is the spring stiffness
- $F(t)$ is the external force

## Types of Damping

There are three main types of damping behavior:

1. **Underdamped** ($\zeta < 1$): The system oscillates with decreasing amplitude
2. **Critically Damped** ($\zeta = 1$): The fastest return to equilibrium without oscillation
3. **Overdamped** ($\zeta > 1$): Slow return to equilibrium without oscillation

## MATLAB Implementation

Here's a simple MATLAB code to simulate an SDOF system:

```matlab
% System parameters
m = 1;      % mass (kg)
c = 0.5;    % damping coefficient (Ns/m)
k = 10;     % stiffness (N/m)

% Initial conditions
x0 = 1;     % initial displacement (m)
v0 = 0;     % initial velocity (m/s)

% Time span
tspan = [0 10];

% ODE function
odefun = @(t, y) [y(2); -c/m*y(2) - k/m*y(1)];

% Solve ODE
[t, y] = ode45(odefun, tspan, [x0; v0]);

% Plot results
figure;
plot(t, y(:,1), 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Displacement (m)');

```

## Practical Applications

Understanding SDOF vibrations is crucial in:

- **Automotive suspension design**
- **Building earthquake resistance**
- **Machine tool vibration control**
- **Acoustic isolation systems**

## Conclusion

SDOF systems provide a foundation for more complex vibration analysis. The principles learned here can be extended to multi-degree-of-freedom systems and continuous systems.
